				<!--About Me-->
				<p class="mt-5">
					Design, development, management and organization, that is my definition of IT. <br>
					<br> By nature, I have perseverance, and I'm rigorous, enthusiastic, never fully satisfied, and always listening. I began web development at 12, which is now my preferred field. I am currently a French student in IT engineering (fifth and last year),and concepteor DevOps. I'm trained to develop innovative websites in modern languages.
					<br>
					<br> I train myself with a lot of online trainings, on websites like uDemy, Microsoft Virtual Academy, and others because front-end languages change every day.
					<br>
					<br> Passionate about IT, but also aeronautics and music creation, I am interested in innovation in multiple fields, which permits me to learn new things about them!
